# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Physical Security

## Overview:

Welcome to the Introduction to Cybersecurity course! In this module, we'll delve into the fundamentals of physical security, an essential aspect of safeguarding information systems and assets against physical threats.

## Sources:

1. **Book**: "Principles of Information Security" by Michael E. Whitman and Herbert J. Mattord - Chapter 5 covers Physical Security Principles.
2. **Website**: "The Basics of Physical Security" from the SANS Institute provides an introductory overview of physical security concepts.
3. **Article**: "Physical Security Best Practices" on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) website offers insights into industry standards and best practices.

## Videos:

YouTube: "Physical Security Fundamentals" by Professor Messer - This video provides a beginner-friendly introduction to physical security concepts.
YouTube: "Introduction to Physical Security" by SANS Institute - A comprehensive video covering the basics of physical security and its importance in cybersecurity.

## Standard and Best Practices:

1. **Access Control** : Implementing access controls such as keycard entry systems, biometric scanners, and security guards to restrict unauthorized access to physical facilities.
2. **Perimeter Security**: Establishing barriers, fences, and gates around facilities to deter unauthorized entry and protect assets.
3. **Surveillance Systems**: Installing CCTV cameras and monitoring systems to surveil and record activities within and around the premises.
4. **Alarm Systems**: Deploying alarm systems that trigger alerts in response to unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.
5. **Security Policies and Procedures**: Developing and enforcing security policies and procedures related to physical security, including employee training on security protocols and emergency response plans.
6. **Physical Environment Considerations**: Considering environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and power supply to ensure the optimal functioning of security systems and equipment.
7. **Regular Assessments and Audits**: Conducting periodic assessments and audits of physical security measures to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

# Lesson 2: Understanding Tailgating in Cybersecurity

## What is Tailgating?

<img src="/img/tailgating.png" alt="Tailgating" width="100" />

Tailgating in cybersecurity is when someone who does not have permission to enter a secure area follows closely behind someone who does have permission. This can happen in physical spaces, like buildings, or in digital spaces, like computer networks.

## Imagine This:

Think about your school. There's a special room where only teachers are allowed because it has important things like tests and private information about students. A student who tries to sneak into this room by following closely behind a teacher is doing something like tailgating.

## Why is Tailgating a Problem?

Tailgating is dangerous because it allows unauthorized people to access places or information they shouldn't. This can lead to theft, damage, or misuse of important data. In the digital world, tailgating might mean someone getting into a computer system without permission, which can lead to hacking or stealing sensitive information.

### Examples:

1. **Physical Tailgating**: A stranger follows an employee into a secure office building without showing a badge.
2. **Digital Tailgating**: Someone uses another person's login information to access a secure website or network.

## How to Prevent Tailgating:

1. **Be Alert**: Always be aware of who is around you when entering a secure area. Don’t let anyone you don’t recognize or trust follow you inside.
2. **Use Security Measures**: Make sure doors and gates close properly behind you. Use things like key cards or passwords to make sure only authorized people can get in.
3. **Report Suspicious Activity**: If you see someone trying to sneak in, tell a teacher, security officer, or an adult in charge right away.

# Lesson 3: Introduction to Dumpster Diving in Cybersecurity

## What is Dumpster Diving?

<img src="/img/dumpster.png" alt="dumpster" width="100" />

Dumpster diving in the context of cybersecurity is a method where someone goes through the trash (dumpster) to find valuable information that can be used to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. This information could be anything from discarded documents, notes, or even old electronic devices that haven't been properly wiped of data.

## Why is it Important to Know About Dumpster Diving?

Even though it sounds like something from a spy movie, dumpster diving is a real threat. People can find sensitive information that hasn't been disposed of correctly, such as:

- Passwords: Written down on paper or sticky notes.
- Personal Information: Names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers.
- Financial Data: Bank statements, credit card details.
- Corporate Information: Internal memos, business plans, confidential reports.

# Lesson 4: Securing Your Computer

## Why is it Important to Secure Your Computer?

<img src="/img/computer.png" alt="dumpster" width="100" />

Imagine if someone broke into your house and took your favorite toys or important schoolwork. That's what can happen if your computer isn't secure. Bad guys can steal your photos, videos, or even use your computer to do bad things.

## Tips to Secure Your Computer

1. **Use Strong Passwords**
   - What is it? A password is a secret word or phrase that only you know.
   - Why? It stops others from getting into your computer or accounts.
   - How? Make your passwords long and hard to guess. Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, instead of "password123," try "P@ssw0rd!2024."
2. **Keep Your Software Updated**
   - What is it? Software includes your computer’s operating system (like Windows or macOS) and apps.
   - Why? Updates fix problems and protect against new threats.
   - How? Turn on automatic updates in your computer’s settings so it updates by itself.
3. **Install Antivirus Software**
   - What is it? Antivirus software is like a guard dog for your computer. It watches out for viruses and malware (bad software).
   - Why? It finds and removes threats before they can do damage.
   - How? Install a trusted antivirus program and keep it updated.
4. **Be Careful What You Click**
   - What is it? Clicking links or downloading files from unknown sources can be dangerous.
   - Why? Some links and files contain malware.
   - How? Only click on links from people you know and trust. If something looks suspicious, don’t click it.
5. **Use a Firewall**
   - What is it? A firewall is like a security guard for your internet connection.
   - Why? It blocks unwanted connections to your computer.
   - How? Make sure your firewall is turned on in your computer’s settings.
6. **Back Up Your Data**
   - What is it? Backing up means saving copies of your important files.
   - Why? If your computer gets hacked or breaks, you won't lose your stuff.
   - How? Use an external hard drive or a cloud service (like Google Drive or iCloud) to back up your files regularly.
7. **Be Careful with Public Wi-Fi**

   - What is it? Public Wi-Fi is internet you can use in places like coffee shops or libraries.
   - Why? It's not always secure, and hackers can see what you're doing.
   - How? Avoid doing important things like banking or shopping on public Wi-Fi. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) if you must use public Wi-Fi.
