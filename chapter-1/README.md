# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Physical Security

# Lesson 2: Understanding Tailgating in Cybersecurity

## What is Tailgating?

Tailgating in cybersecurity is when someone who does not have permission to enter a secure area follows closely behind someone who does have permission. This can happen in physical spaces, like buildings, or in digital spaces, like computer networks.

## Imagine This:

Think about your school. There's a special room where only teachers are allowed because it has important things like tests and private information about students. A student who tries to sneak into this room by following closely behind a teacher is doing something like tailgating.

## Why is Tailgating a Problem?

Tailgating is dangerous because it allows unauthorized people to access places or information they shouldn't. This can lead to theft, damage, or misuse of important data. In the digital world, tailgating might mean someone getting into a computer system without permission, which can lead to hacking or stealing sensitive information.

### Examples:

1. Physical Tailgating: A stranger follows an employee into a secure office building without showing a badge.
2. Digital Tailgating: Someone uses another person's login information to access a secure website or network.

## How to Prevent Tailgating:

1. Be Alert: Always be aware of who is around you when entering a secure area. Don’t let anyone you don’t recognize or trust follow you inside.
2. Use Security Measures: Make sure doors and gates close properly behind you. Use things like key cards or passwords to make sure only authorized people can get in.
3. Report Suspicious Activity: If you see someone trying to sneak in, tell a teacher, security officer, or an adult in charge right away.
