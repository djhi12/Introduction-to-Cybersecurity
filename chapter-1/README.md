# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Physical Security

## Overview:

Welcome to the Introduction to Cybersecurity course! In this module, we'll delve into the fundamentals of physical security, an essential aspect of safeguarding information systems and assets against physical threats.

## Sources:

1. **Book**: "Principles of Information Security" by Michael E. Whitman and Herbert J. Mattord - Chapter 5 covers Physical Security Principles.
2. **Website**: "The Basics of Physical Security" from the SANS Institute provides an introductory overview of physical security concepts.
3. **Article**: "Physical Security Best Practices" on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) website offers insights into industry standards and best practices.

## Videos:

YouTube: "Physical Security Fundamentals" by Professor Messer - This video provides a beginner-friendly introduction to physical security concepts.
YouTube: "Introduction to Physical Security" by SANS Institute - A comprehensive video covering the basics of physical security and its importance in cybersecurity.

## Standard and Best Practices:

1. **Access Control** : Implementing access controls such as keycard entry systems, biometric scanners, and security guards to restrict unauthorized access to physical facilities.
2. **Perimeter Security**: Establishing barriers, fences, and gates around facilities to deter unauthorized entry and protect assets.
3. **Surveillance Systems**: Installing CCTV cameras and monitoring systems to surveil and record activities within and around the premises.
4. **Alarm Systems**: Deploying alarm systems that trigger alerts in response to unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.
5. **Security Policies and Procedures**: Developing and enforcing security policies and procedures related to physical security, including employee training on security protocols and emergency response plans.
6. **Physical Environment Considerations**: Considering environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and power supply to ensure the optimal functioning of security systems and equipment.
7. **Regular Assessments and Audits**: Conducting periodic assessments and audits of physical security measures to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

# Lesson 2: Understanding Tailgating in Cybersecurity

## What is Tailgating?

<img src="/img/tailgating.png" alt="Tailgating" width="100" />

Tailgating in cybersecurity is when someone who does not have permission to enter a secure area follows closely behind someone who does have permission. This can happen in physical spaces, like buildings, or in digital spaces, like computer networks.

## Imagine This:

Think about your school. There's a special room where only teachers are allowed because it has important things like tests and private information about students. A student who tries to sneak into this room by following closely behind a teacher is doing something like tailgating.

## Why is Tailgating a Problem?

Tailgating is dangerous because it allows unauthorized people to access places or information they shouldn't. This can lead to theft, damage, or misuse of important data. In the digital world, tailgating might mean someone getting into a computer system without permission, which can lead to hacking or stealing sensitive information.

### Examples:

1. **Physical Tailgating**: A stranger follows an employee into a secure office building without showing a badge.
2. **Digital Tailgating**: Someone uses another person's login information to access a secure website or network.

## How to Prevent Tailgating:

1. **Be Alert**: Always be aware of who is around you when entering a secure area. Don’t let anyone you don’t recognize or trust follow you inside.
2. **Use Security Measures**: Make sure doors and gates close properly behind you. Use things like key cards or passwords to make sure only authorized people can get in.
3. **Report Suspicious Activity**: If you see someone trying to sneak in, tell a teacher, security officer, or an adult in charge right away.
